        <h1 class="school-name">Universal Higher Secondary School</h1>
        <p>
          Universal Higher Secondary School, established in 2049 B.S., is the
          academic shrine for all meritorious and promising children who
          genuinely desire a meaningful life. One of the visions of this English
          medium school is to impart education to serve humanity because service
          to mankind is service to God. It dedicates itself to providing
          excellence, glory and militancy to students. It further aims at the
          all-round development, i.e. intellectual, physical, social and
          spiritual: a holistic approach of teaching. It helps students excavate
          best out of their life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our text books, curricula, methods and environment are highly
          student-oriented: a child-centered approach. We follow a well-graded
          language books direct method, and communicative approach in teaching
          the language. As to teaching L2, our teachers act as facilitators to a
          great possible extent.
        </p>
        <p>
          The school strives diligently to shape the character of children in
          accordance with their talent. It follows the mode from general to
          special to cope with ever growing competitive and interdependent
          world. Students are facilitated to integrate their thoughts, words and
          action and also to bring out an awareness of discipline, duty and
          devotion at the same time. We believe in dedication, excellence and
          celebration.
        </p>
        <p>
          We lay emphasis on the holistic approach of teaching to have the
          balanced development of a student.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time, we are both eclectic and interdisciplinary in
          selection and the implementation of the teaching learning methods and
          strategies.

            <p>Dear Students,</p>
            <p>
              First of all, on behalf of Universal Higher Secondary School as
              well as person ally, I would like to extend my heart-felt welcome
              to all the future stars who are eagerly, diligently and wisely
              making an effort to build up their future by learning and earning
              the quality education. Quality education is not a matter of luck
              but the matter of effort and choice. As rightly said by Florence
              Nightingale, the first need to accomplish is not planning but the
              commitment. By this I mean we are com mitted to quality education
              and what we expect from students is their commitment and then
              planning plus. We want our students to become an excellent
              thinker, an excellent planner and an excellent performer coupled
              with vision, mission, objectives and strategies. We ever wish to
              see them as leaders in the field concerned.
            </p>
            <p>
              We welcome all the meritorious students to join U2 BBS programme
              because we believe in what Shiv Kehra has said, &quot;Winners
              don&#39;t do different things but they do things
              differently.&quot; Therefore, we offer you BBS with BBA flavor. In
              other words, we focus on the skills, higher abilities, creative
              and critical thinking, inventive and innovative methods so that
              our students can be the jack of all trades and the master of one
              in the true sense and so that they can groom themselves as
              inspirational leaders professionally as well as personally. We lay
              emphasis not on giving the fish but in teaching them how to fish
              so that they can create the win-win situation.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are well-equipped both in software and hardware to pursue all
              the programmes of ours in sustainable, inspirational, professional
              and rewarding ways. We believe in, &quot;Hope for the best but
              prepare for the worst.&quot;
            </p>
            <p>Ever looking forward to everything positive in life!</p>
